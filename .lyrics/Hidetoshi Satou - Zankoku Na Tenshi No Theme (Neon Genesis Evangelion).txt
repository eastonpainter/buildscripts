In your arms, you are holding up the heavens
Young boy, you'll live up to be a legend!

And though the clear blue wind blows
Right on the door of my heart for awhile
You're standing there, and calmly you stare
And without a care, I see you smile
Too deep in yearning, we need
Something to hold and something to keep
Innocent eyes could not realize
The meaning of destiny!

But someday I promise that you'll start to notice
What's there on your shoulders someday
Wings that are strong, they will guide you along
To the future that holds your fate!

Let me tell you a cruel angel's thesis
Flying high from the window, finding egress
There is something betraying all my memories
Burning pathos, emotion overwhelming!
In your arms, you are holding up the heavens
Young boy, you'll be shining like a legend!
