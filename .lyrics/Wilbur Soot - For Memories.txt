We all move on
Some faster than others
We all know
We all sacrifice
In a bath late in the evening
Building up sorrow

But I can't say that I
Wasted my time
'Cause I'm built by you
And I can't say that I
Am glad it is over
'Cause that wouldn't be true
So thank you
Oh, thank you

We both remember
That day in the summer
When you were sat on me
And we cried
Oh, how we cried
In that moment
We've never been so happy

But I can't say that I
Wasted my time
'Cause I'm built by you
And I can't say that I
Am glad it is over
'Cause that wouldn't be true
So thank you
Oh, thank you
All I can say is thank you

But I can't say that I
Won't miss you
