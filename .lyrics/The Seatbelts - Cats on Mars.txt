[Ms. Frizzle:]
Seat belts, everyone!

[Arnold:]
Please, let this be a normal field trip

[Wanda:]
With the Friz?

[Kids:]
No way!

[Arnold:]
Oh!

Cruisin' on down Main Street
You're relaxed and feelin' good
Next thing that you know you're seein'
Octopus in the neighborhood!

Surfin' on a sound wave
Swingin' through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars

On the magic school bus
Navigate a nostril
Climb on the magic school bus
Spank a plankton, too (Take That!)
On our magic school bus
Raft a river of lava
On the magic school bus
Such a fine thing to do!

So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and don't be shy
Come on
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie

On the magic school bus
Step inside it's a wilder ride!
Come on!
Ride on the magic school bus!
