She's always asking, "Am I alright?"
As if auspicious or in my pint
I'll find the answer or a good night
Thank God the time is short
And, yes, you always do that one thing
When you wrinkle up the nose bridge
I'm trying to figure out what that meant
I took it as a taunt

Remember way back then in school?
Oh, did anybody ever say no to you? Woah
Did anybody ever say no to you? Woah
And I don't think I have a clue
'Cause, well, did anybody ever say no to you?
Oh, did anybody ever say no to you? Woah

You're always trying to leave the table
Phone calls, toilet breaks, unstable
And don't you think that we can all tell?
You're insecure, you're insecure
I guess I always do that one thing
When I get too drunk and jump in
To figure out what makes your brain tick
I'm a listener, I'm a listener

Remember way back then in school?
'Cause, well, did anybody ever say no to you? Woah
Did anybody ever say no to you? Woah
But I don't think I have a clue
'Cause, well, did anybody ever say no to you?
Oh, does anybody ever say no to you? Woah

Woo
And I don't think so
'Cause I don't think so

Forget the number for the cab call
As you're dashing out the front door
You claim to try to dodge the catcalls
Thank God the time is short
And, yes, you always do that one thing
'Cause when you throw and drench me under your drink
I'm trying to figure out what that means
I took it as a taunt
