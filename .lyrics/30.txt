I'm nervous, so nervous
I overeat, I lack purpose
And I'm only scratching the surface (Hey)
And I'm not shelved 'cause sex sells
But how long 'til I'm canceled?
This is 30, fucking 30
I'm still here, I'm still dirty

I made it, I'm a flower
I don't sleep, I don't shower (Gross)
I masturbate twice every hour (That's fucking disgusting)
And my band's sick 'cause my head's sick (Yeah, okay)
I get drunk and I'm reckless
Stalk my Twitter, stan my bullshit
This is 30, something is wrong with me!

Ah, ah, ah!
Yeah, he, he!

So raise up your glasses to going out of fashion
To acronyms, sex scams, and social distractions
'Cause everything's changing and I don't know shit about shit

I'm older, I got wrinkles
I still complain I get pimples
I miss when everything was simple (Hey)
The sex past too fast
I ask, "How long did your ex last?"
I'm fucking worthless, I'm unhappy
This is 30, yeah!

Ah, ah, ah!
Yeah, he, he!
Woo!

Ugh, so get off your asses and take down the masses
Socialist, fascist, the world is all plastic
Everyone thinks it, but they don't know shit about shit

You treat me like a baby
Forgive me when I'm wrong
You love me when I'm crazy
I'm alright, but I hate that song
(Attention to the world, there's something wrong with me)
You treat me like a baby
(But sing the words and I pretend I'm 23)
Forgive me when I'm wrong
(I'll please the crowd and I'll put out the candlelight)
You love me when I'm crazy
You know my only wish is for a better life

(Attention to the world, there's something wrong with me)
Don't treat me like a baby
(But sing the words and I pretend I'm 23)
And fight me when I'm wrong
(I'll please the crowd and I'll put out the candlelight)
And smack me when I'm crazy
I'm alright, but I hate that song
