Don't go in there
You'll become one
Freaky creatures
Monster party
Eyes of yellow
Scales and feathers
Tails in tethers
Turn the lights off

Bend the nightmare
You control it
Artful dodger
Easy does it
Shut the closet
Get under the covers
Snakes and lovers
Turn the lights off

Everybody likes to get taken for turns
To see how bright the fire inside of us burns
And everybody wants to get evil tonight
But all good devils masquerade under the light

Here's the pinky
There's the kinky
Everybody complicate it
Man and woman
Baby child
Calm and wild
Turn the lights off

Don't remember (day's gone)
What we look like (night's on)
Younger holding (day's gone)
One another (light's passed)
Paper colors (day's gone)
Dangle streaming (night's on)
Tangle screaming (light's gone)
Turn the lights off

Everybody likes to get taken for turns
To see how bright the fire inside of us burns
And everybody wants to get evil tonight
But all good devils masquerade under the light

Can't they take it
Should be stronger
Books abandoned
Breathe the water
Mind distracted (bad girls)
Sons and daughters (good boys)
Out for slaughter (bad guys)
Turn the lights off

Sparkles and shines on the water (bet you've got a bone to pick with me)
Seeps through the cumulus brume (bet you've got a bone to pick with me)
Tingles and tears while we're gazing (bet you've got a bone to pick with me)
Vanishes soon after bedtime for good (bet you've got a bone to pick with me)

Don't you like it (day's gone)
I know I do (night's on)
How about you? (day's gone)
What do we know (light's passed)
Tiny patterns (day's gone)
Hypnotizing (night's on)
Terrorizing (light's gone)
Turn the lights off

Everybody likes to get taken for turns
To see how bright the fire inside of us burns
And everybody wants to get evil tonight
But all good devils masquerade under the light

Chroma diamonds
Twinkle brightly
Dance in darkness
Blow the nights off
Sleepy child
Spark desire
Walk the fire
