Doctor Feelgood
Sleepin’ on a concrete bench
Can I get a witness?
Miss South Carolina 1975,
Somebody stole your crown.
You were sleeping
In your happy home,
When you woke up baby,
Your life had come and gone.
Now you’re mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world.

Brother Lovejoy
Rappin’ up a blue streak
Can I get a witness?
Miss Hurricane can’t
Keep your hands still
Long enough to count your change.
You were wrapped up
In your daily grind,
The cost of living
It didn’t even cross your mind.
Now you’re mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world.

Mr. Blueprint
Used to have it figured out
Now you can’t find your car.
Miss Cocktaill dress
Standing at the bathroom sink
Looking for a back way out.
You can’t believe your very eyes.
Everything that you were counting on
Was nothing but a pack of lies.
Now you’re mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world.

Now you’re mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule, used to rule, used to rule the world.
