It's 3:45 (AM)
And I just bite my tongue
Update me on your life
And now you've found the one
But I don't like his eyes
And I distrust their name
And I hate their haircut
They look like a prick (A prick)
But it's all the same
Would it be daft of me to cry?
Your tongue is razor sharp
I miss when it would fight mine
Left your heart on standby
By the way he holds you
Bet he serenades you
I can't really blame you

And I can still smell her perfume
Did it rub off on you?
And I can still smell her perfume
Did it rub off on you?
You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman
Well, I say you need better standards
You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman
I say you need better standards!

It seems like all our friends
Abruptly fell in love
And she was in the dust
Darling, life was streaming past
So she learnt to lie
She learnt how to pretend
A drama in the futile
A means to an end
Why can't you be a dick?
Why must you be so nice?
It's hard for me to move on
When I don't really hate you
(I don't really hate you)
(I don't really hate you)
(I don't really hate you)

And I can still smell her perfume
Did it rub off on you?
And I can still smell her perfume
Did it rub off on you?

It's 3:45
Your taxi's not arrived
I don't think that he's coming
