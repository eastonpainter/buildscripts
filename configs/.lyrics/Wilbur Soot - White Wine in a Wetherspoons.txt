Yeah, I'm recording
One, two, three, four

Bouncer greets us at the door
He can tell we've been here before
So he lets us pass
And we climb up 15 flights of stairs
And find that spot in the corner just over there

It's only 6:30 but we're starting to drink
I'm ordering the usual
I think I need a change of pace
London's bursting at the seams
It's not quite the place I hoped I'd be

It's white wine in a Wetherspoons
It's fine dining with cheap perfume
It's country walks down the motorway
How many drugs have you done today?

'Cause concrete sculptures and broken glass
It's the lamp posts who guide our paths
Because the moon can't get in
And the clouds hang heavy
Blocking out his pursuit
And booze hangs limply on our rental suits

'Cause we're fires, we're burning bright
Breaking bottles and starting fights
But the evening has other plans
Run as they pull up with two more vans

It's white wine in a Wetherspoons
It's fine dining with cheap perfume
It's country walks down the motorway
How many drugs have you done today?

But I won't fuss
I'll let you pass
No, I won't fuss
I'll let you pass

'Cause it's only white wine in a Wetherspoons
Fine dining with cheap perfume
DLR closed due to workers' strikes
God knows how I'll get home tonight
