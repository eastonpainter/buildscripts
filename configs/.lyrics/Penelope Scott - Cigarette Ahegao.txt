As an Amewican
Fuck!

So like
I guess they call it the sophomore slump
Always crying and always drunk
A few dead more gone and the rest well
On their way

Thanks!
I hate it

So everyone I love is stuck
Because this that the other and the state fucked up
I mean we covered it in a class
That I'm about to fail

Well, I feel better now (UwU)
Cigarette ahegao (Uh huh)
I haven't had another episode, except last night was touch and go
No need to cry about it

UwU
UwU
Hey incels? Just have sex!
Duh!

Trash on the walls
And trash on the floor
Liquid eyeliner stuck to the door
Screwing everything up and doing everything wrong
In my defense I wasn't supposed to be around this long so

Well I feel better now (UwU)
Cigarette ahegao (UwU)
No need to cry about it (UwU)

Oh, I don't smoke; I just like how it smells

Get thin on smoke and coffee
Get fat on pie and biscuits
God bless this perfect shitstorm I-
Hope that it takes me with it
I have a soft small body
Strawberries make it happy
Someday I'll leave the country
I hope to have you with me

Get wrecked on becherovka
Get fucked on smoke and wine
Someday I'll have my own life
I'll leave this all behind
