I figured out what can move me
It's trains and hugs, planes and sushi
And I'm sorry, but Boris, I'm leaving
I'm not good for anyone here

We reached the end of a decade
Greenwich morphs to an arcade
Suffolk turns into a highway
Up to Hamlet's a tax break
New Islington, a headache
And Richmond's still shit

I can't believe that I'm leaving
I can't believe that I'm leaving
I don't think I want to leave you
I don't think I want to leave you here alone

But they'll knock down the pubs before helping you
And burn down your towers before helping you
They'll charge for your healthcare before helping you
They'll make you jump under trains before helping you

And even though I'm finished, I'm not quite done with it
No matter how far I run south, I'm always there
My lovers, my colleagues, my best friends and enemies
I don't think I want to leave you
